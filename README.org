** To create presentations

Clone this repo, update the [[To host a presentation][link below]], then update the ~index.org~ file as
required.

I use this repository for hosting images or other content that I would like to
embed into presentations that are not available on the public domain in order to
make slide decks transportable, and only require a working internet connection.

Add local resources in the ~./assets~ directory. Alternatively, can copy the
relevant =url= of the resource yo find on the internet and add into the slide
deck appropriately. The latter is particularly recommended for online video
content, e.g., YouTube, which can be embedded into the presentation.
