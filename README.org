** To create presentations

Clone this repo, then update the ~index.org~ file as required. Add local
resources in the ~./assets~ directory. Alternatively, can copy the relevant
=url= of the resource and add into the slide deck appropriately. The latter is
particularly recommended for online video content, e.g., YouTube, which can be
embedded into the presentation.

No need to update the GitHub pages link below so that it points to your
repository.

I will use this repository for hosting images or other content that I would like
to embed into presentations that are not available on the public domain in order
to make slide decks transportable, and only require a working internet connection.
