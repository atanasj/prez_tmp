* Acknowledgement of Country

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which this meeting is
  taken place, the Dharawal people.
- I also want to recognise any other traditional lands and peoples that
  participants may be joining from via Zoom.
- I pay our respects to their Elders past, present, and emerging.
- I extend this respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples joining us today.

* Learning Outcomes

- Develop knowledge around the different kinds of Group Interventions
- Understand the key aspects of a therapeutic group
- Recognise group dynamics and their use for a more effective intervention

* Where are you now?

Think of a setting in which you plan to work. List the different kinds of groups
you might lead in that setting.


1. Experience with Individuals
2. Experience with Groups
3. Planning and Organisation Skills
4. A Good Understanding of Basic Human Conflicts and Dilemmas
5. A Good Understanding of Psychological Theory


#+BEGIN_NOTES

Rate yourself on these skills, based (10 being excellent at the skill). If you are not
an 8, 9, or 10, what is your plan for improving on the given skill? (You may
want to skip the skill of knowledge of the topic because that will depend on the
ass topic.)


1. Experience with Individuals: based on you current training...
2. Experience with Groups: based on your current training...
3. Planning and Organisation Skills: this could be any skills, not necessarily groups
4. A Good Understanding of Basic Human Conflicts and Dilemmas: shame,
   attachment, and the ANS.
5. A Good Understanding of Psychological Theory: theory of mind, underlying
   theory of psychopathology, and appropriate interventions, how do we change.

Group activity

Get participant up to demonstrated current understanding, introduce self and
provide current understanding.

NOTE consider ZOOM approach to same

Bracketing is a way to validate your research process and results.

* Group Interventions

** Different Group Interventions

[cite/t:@scheidlinger1982] proposed four related categories of group
interventions:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (grow grow none none) :frag_idx (2 1 3 4)
1. *Clinical group psychotherapy*
2. *Human development and training groups (T-groups)*
3. *Therapeutic Groups in Mental Health Settings*
4. *Self-Help and Mutual-Help Groups*

#+begin_notes
Get some input as to examples of each.
Note, that we will mostly be exposed to 1 and 3, and 1 will require more skills
development, however, usually 3 is part of 1 in some way.

Structured to less structured.

1. *Clinical Group Psychotherapy*:
   1. Led by trained mental health pros.
   2. Targets emotional interaction, personality dysfunctions.
   3. Requires prior assessments, acceptance of therapy.

2. *Human Development and Training Groups*:
   1. Educational focus.
   2. Include consciousness-raising, sensitivity training.
   3. Methods: Laboratory Method, Self-analytic groups.

3. *Therapeutic Groups in Mental Health Settings*:
   1. Various approaches beyond formal therapy.
   2. Aim to aid remediation, optimize functioning.
   3. Examples: art therapy, therapeutic community, occupational therapy

4. *Self-Help and Mutual-Help Groups*:
   1. Voluntary, for shared issues.
   2. Self-governing, emphasise self-reliance.
   3. Categories:
      1. Behavioural control (e.g., AA).
      2. Stress coping (e.g., Al-Anon).
      3. Survival-oriented (e.g., Gay Rights).
      4. Personal growth (e.g., Landmark Forum).

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Whilst there are new skills to develop, there are multiple benefits to this

*Individual Therapy:*
- One-on-one interaction between therapist and client.
- Personalised and tailored treatment plans.
- Confidential exploration of client's issues.
- Techniques and interventions adapted to client's needs.
- Safe space for vulnerable sharing.
- Intensive work on personal goals.

*Group Therapy:*
- Multiple clients with one or more therapists.
- Utilizes group dynamics for diverse perspectives and support.
- Benefits from shared experiences and peer feedback.
- Fosters sense of community and reduces isolation.
- Opportunities to practice social skills.
- Observing different coping mechanisms in real-time.

** Importance of group therapy in clinical practice

- Clinic /saves time, space and professionals/
- /No difference in outcome/ with individual therapy [cite: e.g.,
  @burlingame2016; @burlingame2017; @mackenzie1996]
- Feedback from /peers/ in group therapy /helps patient reflect on their
  behaviour/ patterns
- Although /different approaches/ (cognitive, behavioural, psychodynamic) /group
  dynamics are the same/, no matter what the nature of the group
  [cite:@mackenzie1996]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
*Stress the last point* Moreover, fit is important.

- Group psychotherapy can benefit patients depending on the therapy group
  structure and the individual patient.
- There is a wide variety of group psychotherapy approaches with different
  designs and practices [cite:@shay2017].
- Clinical indications for group therapy can be narrow (e.g., based on DSM
  diagnosis or specific problems) with a homogenous group membership.
- Indications can also be broad (e.g., difficulties in interpersonal
  relationships, emotional dysregulation) with a heterogeneous group membership.
- Therapy groups can be short-term and focused on specific problems or themes.
- /What is required is some modification of technique to maximise the effects
  while taking the role of time seriously./
#+END_NOTES

** Group Therapy is...

Much more than one entity:

- Practised with /different/ populations (narrow to homogenous)
- In /different/ settings (inpatient, outpatient, online)
- Using /different/ approaches (psychoeducation, support, etc.)
- Based on /different/ theories of mind and psychopathology
- With /different/ degrees of success

The accent here is on /DIFFERENCES/.

#+REVEAL_HTML:<center><b>How can a clinician new to this modality navigate its diversity to develop their own approach to leading a group?
#+REVEAL_HTML:</b></center>

#+BEGIN_NOTES
An overview of the theories and techniques of the group therapies requires focus.

- You still need an underlying theory of human behaviour and psychopathology to
  help organise your thinking and understanding
- Theoretical models identify dysfunctional patterns across various levels of
  psychological functioning.
- Different approaches focus on overt behavior, cognitive style, interpersonal
  patterns, or internal attribution of meaning.
- Some models concentrate on the present, while others emphasise the past.
- All models address issues of self-esteem and mastery of the interpersonal
  environment.
- Clinicians need to employ intervention techniques at different levels for
  different patients and possibly for the same patient over time.
- Flexibility and intentional use of multiple models is a beneficial strategy
  for clinicians.

And just like in individual therapy, there will be therapist factors and
individual factors that contribute to outcome
